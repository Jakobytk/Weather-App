# Weather-App

## Description

- I wanted to create a webpage that allowed me to see the weather up to five days.
- I wanted to be able to see the temp and UV's
- I wanted to select what city's I was going to be able to look into.
- I wanted the city's to stay in a list in storage to be reused if needed.
- I did not get anywhere near doing that
